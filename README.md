# EU Portal Fixer
Mozilla Addon to fix issues in EU Portal.

# Issues fixed
The add-on simply fixes a few issues with the EU portal. For now:
- The missing transparency requests from the Electronic Access to Commission Documents (EASE) portal by changing the number of requested items to a higher number than the limited 10 items displayed by the EASE portal.
- The broken meetings parliamentary meeting's portal when searching for an item non-alphabetical symbol such as a space.
